## Professional Experience

---

### Information Extraction and Synthesis Lab, UMass
#### Research Intern

1. Evaluated the effect of data modeling choice in language tasks on model performance, by training BERT on the UW Event Factuality dataset modeled as an (1) NLI and (2) classiﬁcation task.

### Amazon Alexa A.I
#### Graduate Student Researcher

1. Analyzed the common sense reasoning capabilities of language models by training a Transformer sequence-to-sequence model to generate an explanation, given a nonsensical sentence from the SemEval20 dataset.
2. Improved explanations by applying domain adaptation, knowledge graph integration, and multi-task learning.
3. Applied decoding strategies like (temperature, Top-K) sampling methods to improve Bleu score by 16%.
4. Surveyed relevant text datasets and identiﬁed 7 commonsense type to probe the Transformer model’s performance.
5. Enhanced the SemEval dataset by adding commonsense type annotations by launching MTurk experiments.

### Ola, Bangalore
#### Senior Software Engineer

1. Architected and developed the agent portal for document veriﬁcation of drivers in Typescript with a Node backend. Reduced driver onboard time from 2 weeks to < 1 hr by creating a multi-tenant document collection system. Supported no-deployment conﬁguration creation, improving time to market (TTM).
2. Improved the turnaround time (TAT) of 5 teams by developing a library of 25 reusable UI components.
3. Automated micro-services API management with a CLI script supporting batch creation and deletion.
4. Reduced the size of driver onboarding web application by 75% and improved load time by 1.5x for 1.2M drivers, through client service worker caching and dead-code elimination.

### Samsung Research, Bangalore
#### Software Engineer

1. Trained and validated intent classiﬁcation models for Bixby A.I assistant and integrated them with the browser.
2. Increased the active monthly users from 12k to 90k of Samsung’s browser bookmark manager extension, through data-driven redesign, code miniﬁcation. Improved user experience through optimistic updates to the UI.

#### Software Intern

1. Developed an alternate tab manager for the open-source Chrome browser and tested its usability.

## Research 

---

#### 1. Word embedding performance in Dialogue State Tracking module of dialogue systems

Assessed the performance of word embeddings (GLoVe, fastText) in the utterance encoder of a dialogue system. Incorporated an external Knowledge Graph by using ConceptNet embeddings to improve zero-shot generalization.

#### 2. A Survey on Conversational AI in Task-oriented and Question-Answering Tasks

Investigated the evolution of dialogue systems from hand-crafted rules and statistical approaches to recent end-to-end data-driven neural methods.

#### 3. Semantic Segmentation with Deep Convolutional Networks using ASPP module

Designed a PyTorch model for the Semantic Segmentation task, using Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module (DeepLabV3). Trained the model on GCloud using the MS-COCO dataset.

#### 4. Hierarchical feature learning in neural networks by patch training

Improved the image classiﬁcation recall rate of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), by training on image sub-samples of the PascalVOC dataset.
